# Code Surfer Dev - Apple II+ Documented

I purchased an Apple II+ on ebay back in January of 2022. It collected dust on
my "Retro Computing Hall of Fame" display shelf until December 2023, when I
purchased a disk II floppy drive on ebay. Having the floppy drive has lite a
fire under my butt to dig into this iconic personal computer, and this document
repo is a compilation of my own personal notes on the internals and how
everything works.

Much has been taken from archived books and manuals, blogs, and other sources. I
will link sources wherever possible.
